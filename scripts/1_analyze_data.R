#domain score######################################################

#Add rating scores across all items of a given subscale (i.e. ‘E’, “F’, ‘H/S’, ‘R’, or ‘S’) 
#to obtain the domain score. 
#Either use this sum or divide the domain score by the number of items (i.e. 3 or 6) in the given subscale.

#Scoring instructions for risk—return interpretation of domain-specific risk-taking scale:
#Risk attitude can be conceptualized in the risk-return framework of risky choice used in finance. 
#In this framework, people’s preference for risky options is assumed to reflect a tradeoff between 
#an option’s expected benefit, usually equated to expected value (EV), and its riskiness. 
#In finance, riskiness of an option is equated to its variance, but psychological risk-return models 
#treat perceived riskiness as a variable that can differ between individuals and as a function of 
#content and context:

# Preference (X) = a(Expected Benefit(X)) + b(Perceived Risk(X)) + c

#1. To find the coefficients a(Expected Benefit(X)) and b(Perceied Risk(X)), regress “Expected Benefits” and 
    #“Risk-Perceptions” on “Risk-Taking” for each participant, using corresponding scores from each item, 
    #as shown in Table 2 below. Note: A positive coefficient b indicates risk-seeking behavior and a 
    #negative coefficient b indicates risk-aversion behavior.
#2.  Calculate risk-attitude using the formula above.


#X  a(Expected Benefits(X))	b(Perceived Risk(X))
# x = Betting a day's income at the horse races
